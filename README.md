Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances </br>
<br> In this challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required activity. This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file. </br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

<ul>
 <li>
The total number of months included in the dataset.</li>
<li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.</li>
<li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/Number of months) </li>
<li>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period. </li>
<li>The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period. </li>
